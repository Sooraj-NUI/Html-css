          Some time back, we sought a fresh Senior Software Engineer to augment
          our squad. Let’s delve into some figures:
        </p>

        <p>A total of 1,329 people applied.</p>
        <p>We interviewed 37 candidates.</p>
        <p>
          5 candidates went through to the second interview stage (async coding
          challenge + team interview).
        </p>
        <p>3 candidates did the final interview.</p>
        <p>
          We offered the job to 1 candidate who fortunately accepted the offer
          enthusiastically 30 days after we opened the role.
        </p>

        <p>
          An engaging conversation unfolded between Cloudhub's hiring manager
          and myself, post realizing only a mere 13.5% of candidates made it
          past our first round of interview invitations into the subsequent
          phase. This interaction was so insightful that we chose to transcribe
          its main elements into a blog piece about habitual conduct during
          interviews that falls short of our anticipations for a senior
          position.

        <p class="questions">What we don't want:</p>
        <p>
          A brief oral summary of your resume, roughly 10–15 minutes long. Be
          aware, your interviewer will have already reviewed your CV, thus this
          recap can steal valuable time that could be better used addressing
          other queries or going further in-depth.
