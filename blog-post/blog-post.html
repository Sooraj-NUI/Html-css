          Some time back, we sought a fresh Senior Software Engineer to augment
          our squad. Let’s delve into some figures:
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">A total of 1,329 people applied.</p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">We interviewed 37 candidates.</p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          5 candidates went through to the second interview stage (async coding
          challenge + team interview).
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">3 candidates did the final interview.</p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          We offered the job to 1 candidate who fortunately accepted the offer
          enthusiastically 30 days after we opened the role.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          An engaging conversation unfolded between Cloudhub's hiring manager
          and myself, post realizing only a mere 13.5% of candidates made it
          past our first round of interview invitations into the subsequent
          phase. This interaction was so insightful that we chose to transcribe
          its main elements into a blog piece about habitual conduct during
          interviews that falls short of our anticipations for a senior
          position.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">Let's dive in!</p>

        <p class="blog-side-heading">The Introduction</p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph"><strong>What we don't want:</strong></p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          A brief oral summary of your resume, roughly 10–15 minutes long. Be
          aware, your interviewer will have already reviewed your CV, thus this
          recap can steal valuable time that could be better used addressing
          other queries or going further in-depth.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph"><strong>What we expect:</strong></p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">A brief introduction, including:</p>

        <p class="blog-side-heading">Questions</p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph"><strong>What we don’t want:</strong></p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Questions that are already answered in the job description.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph"><strong>What we expect:</strong></p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Pose us challenging queries concerning aspects essential to you in a
          professional setting so you can evaluate us and ascertain we’re a firm
          you’d genuinely aspire to be part of.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">What is your biggest problem right now?</p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          What do you enjoy most about your work? / Why do you stay at Checkly?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">How would you describe the culture?</p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          How does the team deal with mistakes/incidents?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          What does success in this role look like to you?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">Why are you looking for a new [position]?</p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Is leadership on board with this role/function? / Does everyone agree
          this role is needed?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Does everyone agree on how you define this role and the expectations
          of the function?
        </p>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          What is the 30, 60, 90 day outlook for this role / How do the next 3
          months look for the team?
        </p>

        <p class="blog-side-heading">Summary</p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Our senior team members are held to high standards. They must discern
          crucial tasks from irrelevant ones, strategize on ways to make a
          difference to our objectives, offer resolutions to issues, and
          articulate their ideas and reasoning comprehensively.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Although not all firms you engage with will hold identical standards,
          I trust these suggestions will enable you to truly demonstrate your
          potential and secure a role that suits you wonderfully!
